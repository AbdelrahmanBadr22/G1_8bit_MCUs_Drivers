/*
 * We have three ways to implement the delay :
 * ------------------------------------------
 *    1) Using built-in function: This will done by including the built-in lib
 *       for the target and use the built-in function directly.
 *
 *    2) Using busy wait with assembly instructions: This is the same
 *       implementation as built-in function but without including built-in lib
 *
 *    3) Using timer: We can generate a delay by interfacing with timer and
 *       wait for specific time
 *
 * This infrastructure support three ways according to 'DELAY_METHOD' macro
 * with three appropiate values 'DELAY_BUILTIN, DELAY_BUSYWAIT, DELAY_TIMER'
